## About Me ðŸ”Ž
I am an experienced iOS Engineer with a passion for delivering high-quality solutions. Throughout my six years of experience, I have worked with both enterprise-level companies and early-stage startups. I am proficient in all stages of the development cycle - from gathering requirements to shipping products to the App Store with CI/CD.

## Experience
### Marktplaats
Duration: [Jan 2022] - [Present]

At Marktplaats, I was responsible for spearheading efforts to modernize the codebase. This involved converting legacy monolithic code into a modular codebase, using new Swift concurrency features and The Composable Architecture (TCA). I also used the latest SwiftUI to create multiple components for the Design System, resulting in improved lead generation in the iOS app. The modular code was extensively tested using Unit, UI, and Snapshot testing to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.

### Kasra
Duration: [Apr 2016] - [- Nov 2021]

At Kasra, I was instrumental in implementing a server-driven UI using Swift and introduced testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to the iOS team. I led the development of enterprise-level iOS applications for hundreds of clients, including multi-culture applications with different locales. In addition to mentoring and helping other iOS developers, I advanced GPS and Bluetooth usage and real-time tracking in our applications. I also modernized legacy code by converting it to testable architectures and utilized the advanced coordinator pattern in iOS development to enhance the user experience.

### TeleMedicX
Duration: [Nov 2018] - [Jan 2020]

At TeleMedicX, I integrated the Zoom SDK into the iOS app, enabling users to seamlessly use Zoom's video conferencing services. I developed and maintained a Kafka client in Swift, allowing the app to efficiently process and manage large streams of data. I also implemented VOIP call functionality and completed the full integration of Push Kit, enabling real-time communication and updates for the app.
